Loops through the characters in a string to check if they are unique.

In retrospect, there was an easier way of implementing this, but I'll leave my original method because it best shows my initial though process. That is, to make two character arrays and compare them to each other so that

Array1[0] is compared to Array2[1], Array2[2], Array2[3], etc.

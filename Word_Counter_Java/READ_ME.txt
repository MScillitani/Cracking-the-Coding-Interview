This is a simple word counter I made for fun in Java (JDK 17).

It reads any text and outputs how many instances of a user-selected word appears in that text. The text provided is the story of Goldilocks. To try a different text, add it to the folder and then change "goldilocks.txt" to whatever the name of the file you want it to scan is in the Main class's bookSc scanner.

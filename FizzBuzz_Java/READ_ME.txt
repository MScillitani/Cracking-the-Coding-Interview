My take on the classic FizzBuzz problem.

I chose to use a for-loop rather than a while-loop to save a couple lines of code and because it's typically easier to tell what's going on when code is colocated.

Inside the for-loop I declared String r (result) using a ternary operator, saving a handful of lines over an IF/ELSEIF/ELSE block.

Without the class and main method declarations, my take on FizzBuzz uses only four lines of code and retains readability.
